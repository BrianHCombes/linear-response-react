# Specification: Linear Response API 

This is the Linear Response API specification written in reactJS to be viewed in a browser. 

*Note: Had begun learning ReactJS on Oct 3, 2022 and as of Oct 09, 2022 had started building said Linear Response API specification in ResactJS.*

*Note: I picked up the ReactJS basics very quickly but as I convert what I already started in basic HTML, JS, and CSS to ReactJS I expect many learning moments along the way. But that's the fun part.*
