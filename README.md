# linear-response-react 

This is the Linear Response API specification written in reactJS. 

As of Oct 3, 2022 had begun learning ReactJS and as of Oct 09, 2022 have started building said Linear Response API specification in ResactJS

Note: I picked up the ReactJS basics very quickly but as I convert what I already started in basic HTML, JS, and CSS to ReactJS I expect many learning moments along the way. But that's the fun part.
